  <p> The burial practices of ancient Egyptians were complex. To prepare a body for burial and to preserve the body for the afterlife, the body was embalmed through the process of mummification. 
  Mummification was a long process that required over a month to complete. Once a body was ready for burial a funeral was held for the family of the deceased. The funeral included rituals, spells, 
  and good giving to ensure the dead had what they needed for the afterlife.
